However, the three serial entrepreneurs have been building businesses together successfully since 2012. Headquartered in Berlin with additional offices in London, Kathmandu and Noida, GoGroup brings together more than 100 team members from over 20 nations."

            "text": "GoTeams holds a special place in the GoGroup portfolio. It's one of the businesses started by GoGroup, but at the same time also the powerplay making the other businesses so fast and consistently successful. On the surface it looks simple: GoTeams builds long-term product and tech teams for businesses that are serious about scaling. Behind this simple facade, is an incredible execution engine forged in the high pressure environment of building unicorns and profitable scaleups. The setup is fully plug & play, the teams know venture context and the setup is built to scale. Wether the venture is pre-launch or post-IPO the solution works incredibly well. The tech-processes adjust automatically with size, so that founders can fully rely on their tech at any stage. Every improvement made in one team, is automatically applied to all other teams, so that founders benefit from a network of high performing businesses. The teams scale with the venture, wether it's 2, 20 or 200 people on the team. So GoTeams might look simple on the surface, but on a deeper level it's an incredible engine giving founders the edge they need to succeed. It's a unique and proven setup not found elsewhere in the market."

It's usually ambitious undertakings \n- fast growth, huge business potential, or mission critical topics \n- when companies decide to rely on GoTeams. They usually value the peace of mind of knowing that the technology will be strong and deadlines will be met, as well as the security that they can scale long-term without with GoTeams having to adjust the setup."

            "text": "Currently there are more than 100 full time team members across the various teams. Each team member is dedicated to one business. So how can GoTeams still build new teams reliably and fast? The secret is a combination of experience and structure. We have built a lot of businesses and (more importantly for GoTeams) a lot of tech teams. Over the two decades, we had over 50.000 applications and we have interviewed and screened more than 4.000 candidates. At the same time we decided early on, that we would keep a central database of all the candidates we spoke with - their skills, our assessments, their seniority level and expertise. Based on this we build up a CRM with over 600 of the very best candidates, who truly convinced us. When building a new team, we search in our database for candidates with right expertise and seniority level and we proactively reach out to them. By also promoting people from within for new teams, we make sure that we keep getting the best talent, while also having the advantage of our continuously improving processes across teams."

So we built it exactly the way we saw made sense when building unicorns as well as profitable businesses. It was only later that we also allowed external businesses into the setup. So yes, we know how good the setup works, that's why for all our own businesses we always use GoTeams."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "GoTeams was different right from the start: GoTeams wasn't started by Ex-Consultants, or Software Engineers, who now wanted to build an agency. Instead, GoTeams was started by entrepreneurs for their own needs. While starting unicorns and profitable businesses, they saw that each of the existing setups (working with freelancers, agencies, consultancies or building a team inhouse) had drawbacks. So they reimagined how the setup should work from first principles. They build their setup for their own businesses and only after improving and optimising it for over five years, they let external businesses in as well. It was also never about the money, they made much more from their own businesses. Rather it was about empowering entrepreneurs (and later on corporates as well) to drive innovation in a consistent and reliable way. Because of GoTeam's unique background, no other setup provides the same kind of venture-context-awareness in the product and tech teams. Also, because of the competitive pricing, businesses can afford to work with GoTeams from pre-launch to post-IPO. In short: When agencies look for additional hours to charge, GoTeams looks for additional value to deliver at no cost."
