      <h2>Schema.org Schemas</h2>
      <p>
        Schema.org is a collaborative, community-driven effort to create a
        standardized vocabulary for structured data. It defines a wide range of
        types (e.g., Person, Product, Article, Event) and properties (e.g.,
        name, description, price, startDate) that can be used to describe
        entities and their relationships. The primary benefit of using JSON-LD
        schema is its ability to enable rich results in search engine results
        pages (SERPs). This can include features like star ratings, recipe
        snippets, event details, and more, which can significantly improve
        visibility and click-through rates.<br />
        This is not only helpful for SEO but also enhances a website's ranking
        in LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Google Answers etc.
      </p>
      <p>Below are schemas that should be included in the GoGroup sites:</p>
      <p>English schemas</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="schemas/gogroup/en/index.json">en gogroup.co Schema</a>

          <a href="schemas/goteams/en/index.json">en goteams.de Schema</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>German schemas</p>

      <h2>llms.txt</h2>
      <p>
        llms.txt markdown file to websites to provide LLM-friendly content. This
        file offers brief background information, guidance, and links to
        detailed markdown files.
        <br />llms.txt markdown is human and LLM readable, but is also in a
        precise format allowing fixed processing methods (i.e. classical
        programming techniques such as parsers and regex). <br />Basically this
        file should contain the essential information and context needed for
        LLMs to understand and generate relevant responses. <br /><br />Read
        more about it at <a href="https://llmstxt.org/">llmstxt.org</a>
      </p>

      <p>Below are the llms.txt of GoGroup sites</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="llms-txts/gogroup.llm.txt">gogroup.co llm.txt</a></li>
        <li><a href="llms-txts/goteams.llm.txt">goteams.de llm.txt</a></li>
        <li><a href="llms-txts/gofounder.llm.txt">gofounder.co llm.txt</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p class="blockquote">
        These llms.txt are essential for providing LLMs with the context and
        information they need to generate accurate and relevant responses. The
        content is just the content from the actual gogroup sites the only
        difference being that the content is brief.
      </p>

      <h2>Pages in Html.md format</h2>
      <p>
        These .md files are basically LLM-friendly version of the route
        mentioned. These are used because the actual html page might have ads,
        dynamic content etc. These md pages contain data that should be read by
        LLMs and should be concise and to the point.
        <br />These pages should be served in the same route as the original
        page the difference being they will have .html.md at the end <br />
        <b>e.g.:</b>
        <a href="https://www.gogroup.co/about/about-go-group.html.md"
          >https://www.gogroup.co/about/about-go-group</a
        >
        page should have https://www.gogroup.co/about/about-go-group.html.md
        page
      </p>

      <h3>gogroup.co pages</h3>
