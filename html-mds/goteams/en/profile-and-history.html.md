## How it Started

The roots of GoTeams go back to 2015 when brothers **Nico Weiler** and **Sascha Weiler**, together with **Shishir Goel**, were looking for a scalable way to power tech and product for their own entrepreneurial endeavors.

---

### The Key Insight

What they realized: the most pressing bottleneck for digital businesses is not the lack of ideas, sales, or online marketing, but the lack of substantial tech capabilities.

---

### Building the Foundation

They built a tech powerhouse in India - first to empower their own ventures, and later to help third parties grow theirs. Today, it has grown into the backbone of great companies and products, becoming a home for excellent engineers.
