## Biography

Sascha's entrepreneurial journey began during a transformative year in Silicon Valley during high school, where he lived with a successful entrepreneur who introduced him to the world of startups.

Graduating at the top of his class, Sascha pursued business studies at WHU, ranking in the top 5% of his cohort. He then joined the Berlin-based company builder Rocket Internet, where he played a key role in launching the models of Groupon, Zalando, and Wimdu across Europe, Japan, Brazil, and India.

Driven by his entrepreneurial spirit, Sascha left Rocket Internet to launch his first venture, Casacanda, an e-commerce platform for design furniture and accessories. In just seven months, Casacanda became the European market leader and was acquired by the US-based competitor Fab.com. As part of the combined team spanning New York and Berlin, Sascha helped transform Fab.com into one of the fastest unicorns in history, reaching a $1 billion valuation within 18 months. At Fab.com, Sascha led the international product department, staying on board for over four years and contributing to its rapid growth.

Following his time at Fab.com, Sascha turned his focus to the construction industry, founding the SaaS venture Homebell while also co-founding an independent venture studio. Homebell's success culminated in its acquisition by a leading European insurance firm, reinforcing Sascha's commitment to the venture studio model.

During this period, Sascha, along with his co-founders Nico and Shishir, identified a gap in the market for scalable, venture-compatible product and tech teams. This led to the creation of GoTeams and, ultimately, the establishment of GoGroup in 2019.

After graduating, Nico gained hands-on experience in the startup ecosystem at Epic Companies, the company builder of German media conglomerate ProSiebenSat.1 AG, and later at HelloFresh, where he joined as one of its earliest employees, contributing to the early growth of the food-tech unicorn.

## Biography

Shishir’s entrepreneurial journey began in childhood, assisting his father in a high-volume trading business where he gained early, practical insights into operations and business management. Despite initially placing limited focus on academics, his aptitude for problem-solving earned him a place at NIT Hamirpur to study Computer Engineering.

His professional career took off with the prestigious Google Summer of Code, followed by a developer role focused on creating technology products for the U.S. market. At the same time, Shishir pursued his entrepreneurial instincts by co-founding an elevator parts marketplace with friends.

Shishir later joined Fab.com, a rapidly growing e-commerce startup that achieved unicorn status. At Fab, he played a key role in integrating newly acquired businesses into its technology organization. It was during this time that he met Sascha Weiler, whose startup Casacanda had been acquired by Fab.

In 2015, Shishir became the CTO and Head of India Operations at Homebell, where he successfully built a global capability center (GCC) from scratch. Simultaneously, he partnered with Nico Weiler to establish Caroobi’s GCC in India, showcasing his ability to lead and scale engineering operations across geographies.

Recognizing the growing need for robust global engineering centers, Shishir co-founded GoGroup in 2019 alongside Sascha and Nico. Together, they envisioned building long-term, profitable ventures supported by dedicated teams that have been integral to their shared success. Today, Shishir continues to bring his technical expertise and entrepreneurial vision to GoGroup’s innovative ventures, driving impactful and sustainable growth.
